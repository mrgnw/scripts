# Scripts

Isolated files that can be run directly, assuming they are given execution permissions (`chmod +x script_path` and visible in the PATH)

## Languages

```
zsh, swift, python3
```

```sh
#! /usr/bin/env zsh
#! /usr/bin/env swift
#! /usr/bin/env python3
```

Binary files are compiled for apple silicon from the adjacent script

``` sh
cool-thing # binary
cool-thing.swift # original script
```
